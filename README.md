# weather

Goal: Build a weather app to look up any current weather conditions based on the zip code a user supplies.
Requirements:
Create a new folder / GitHub project
Utilize the OpenWeatherMap.org API to get conditions based on a zip code.
https://openweathermap.org/current#zip
Sample API key: ccef2c8c8034982955bec1e0b2a83e36
Show the conditions of a default location when the page is loaded - you can choose the location in the world (as long as the API provides the data for it).
Allow the user to type their zip code into an input box, click a button to get conditions for their specific zip code.
Creatively visualize the conditions of the location using CSS and Font Awesome. If it's hot there, show a sun icon and/or some "hot colors", if it's rainy somewhere, show an appropriate icon / color scheme for that situation as well.
Read through the documentation or look at the sample response from the API to determine the possible ways they can communicate what the conditions are (possibly through the "main.temp" and/or the "weather" array in the response.
Show the name of the location for the zip code the user typed in (also in the API response to use).
